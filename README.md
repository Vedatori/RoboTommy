# RoboTommy robotics platform
RoboTommy is an open source project devoted to be a universal platform 
for robotics, electronics and programming beginners. In construction 
emphasis was placed on broad capabilities of the robot in combination 
with low demands on the tinkerer.

RoboTommy was created as a support tool for robotic classes and summer 
camps in SVC Luzanky in Brno by Martin Ptacek, Petr Vavra, Martin Coufal and Marek Coufal.

This robotic platform is based upon 3D printed differential chassis with 
DC engines controlled by H bridges. For control purposes a combination of 
Aruino Nano Atmega328 and Wemos D1 Mini ESP8266 microcontrollers is used.
